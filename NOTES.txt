To do:
- Fullscreen key
- FPS limiter
- Look into multiple VAOs perhaps not being optimal
- Yaw might be backwards
- Check consistency of matrices being inverted
- Use keypresses as toggles to change position/etc in the physics thread
- Add .mtl files
- Lights
- Add shadows (Shadow mapping?)
- GUI
- Finish parsing level.dat
- Separate the physics into its own thread
- 

Current:
- Vertex normal calculation not working for terrain heightmaps
-
